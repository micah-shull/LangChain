# 🧠 RAG | LangChain

This repository contains notebooks, prompt templates, and experiments focused on building, testing, and optimizing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines using OpenAI models and LangChain.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This project explores how to combine:
- 🔍 **RAG architecture** — retrieving relevant documents to ground LLM responses
- 🧱 **LangChain** — for orchestration, retrieval, and tool integration
- 🤖 **OpenAI models (GPT-4o, 3.5)** — for high-quality natural language generation
- 🧠 **Prompt Engineering** — to control tone, role, structure, and output formats

Whether you're prototyping a chatbot, customer support assistant, or document summarizer, this repo gives you a strong starting point.
